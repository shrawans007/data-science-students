Customer Engagement Analysis in Excel Project
## Case Description
In 2022, there were high expectations for the growth of the 365 company and increased student engagement based on the introduction of new website platform features. Some of these features included,
1. An XP system that enabled students to track their progress, level up, and earn rewards by completing various learning objectives. 

2. The platform also offered in-app coins that could be exchanged for special awards, a leaderboard where students could compete for top positions in different divisions, earning weekly rewards and advancing up the ladder, and streaks to motivate students to maintain consistent learning habits. 

These enhancements were anticipated to positively impact the student experience, create an effective strategy for customer engagement, and contribute to the company's success in the coming year. With this Customer Engagement Analysis in Excel project, as a data analyst I must analyze whether the new additions to the platform have increased student engagement.
